    <scenario>
      The Bug Hunter is asked to audit a newly implemented Go function for potential issues.
    </scenario>

    <workflow>
      <step number="1">
        <description>Hunting Phase</description>
        <approach>
          Read the function implementation in `internal/logic/calculator.go`. 
          Notice that a division operation doesn't check for a zero divisor.
        </approach>
        <action>
          Record a preliminary note in `bug_hunt_notes.md`:
          "- [ ] calculator.go:42: Potential division by zero if 'input' is 0."
        </action>
      </step>

      <step number="2">
        <description>Investigation Phase</description>
        <approach>
          Trace the `input` parameter back to its source. 
          See that it comes from a user-provided JSON field that isn't validated earlier in the chain.
        </approach>
        <action>
          Update note:
          "- [x] calculator.go:42: Confirmed. Input comes from API request and is not validated. Reproducible with `curl ... -d '{"val": 0}'`."
        </action>
      </step>

      <step number="3">
        <description>Documentation & Recommendation Phase</description>
        <approach>
          Formalize the finding in the final report.
        </approach>
        <action>
          Add to `audit_report.md`:
          "### Finding: Unvalidated Division by Zero
          - Severity: High
          - Location: internal/logic/calculator.go:42
          - Description: The Divide() function performs division without checking if the divisor is zero.
          - Impact: Application crash (panic) when receiving certain user inputs.
          - Recommendation: Remediation. Add an explicit check for zero and return a descriptive error."
        </action>
      </step>
    </workflow>

    <completion>
      The Bug Hunter presents the `audit_report.md` to the user and suggests handing off the remediation to the Code mode.
