# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documents and design explorations that are no longer part of the active hashi specification.

## Files

- `configuration_comprehensive_design.md` - Comprehensive configuration system design that was more feature-rich than the final spec. The current spec intentionally chose a simpler approach focused on hashi's core purpose as a hash comparison tool.

## Why These Are Archived

These documents represent valuable design work but contain features that were consciously excluded from the final specification for reasons of:

- **Simplicity**: Keeping hashi focused on its core hash comparison purpose
- **Security**: Avoiding unnecessary complexity that could introduce vulnerabilities  
- **Maintainability**: Reducing feature creep and keeping the codebase manageable

The archived documents serve as historical context for understanding design decisions and may inform future development if requirements change.
